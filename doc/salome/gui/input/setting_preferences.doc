\page setting_preferences_page Setting Preferences

All user preferences of \b SALOME application can be customized using the
common \b Preferences dialog box. This dialog can be invoked using the
<b><i>File > Preferences...</i></b> menu item.

The \b Preferences dialog box consists of two parts:
- Available preferences sections are listed at the left of the dialog
box; usually this list contains "SALOME" item that specifies general
application preferences and separate section for each SALOME module
available in the current session.
- The tabbed widget at the right side of the dialog box provides
controls that can be used to customize the preferences.

\note The preferences for the modules become accessible only after
explicit loading of these modules. Until that time the dialog box will
show corresponding warning message. 

For more details about application preferences can be found in the
following chapters:
- \subpage salome_preferences_page
- \subpage geometry_preferences_page
- \subpage mesh_preferences_page
- \subpage postpro_preferences_page

\subpage select_color_and_font_page "Font and color preferences"
are most oftenly used types of user settings.

When you change settings (click \b OK or \b Apply button) each module
receives the notification about what preferences are changed. You can
also click \b Defaults button to restore default preferences or \b Close
button to quit the dialog box without any changes. 

\b Import button allows loading specific user file containing
preferences from any location at the computer through a standard
Import dialog box.

The preferences files usually have *.xml extension. Also,
preferences files automatically saved by application (stored in the
~/.config/salome directory) have no extension and by default start with
.SalomeApprc. followed by SALOME version number. Usually there is a
separate preferences file for each SALOME version in use. Preferences
are saved to the file in the end of the working session and restored
at the application start-up.

\note The preferences you set will be default preferences for all \b new
objects, but they are not retroactive and do not automatically apply
to the existing objects.
