The <b>Object Browser</b> is supplied with the \b Find toolbox. This tool
allows performing context search of the items in the Object Browser:

The \b Find toolbox can be invoked in several ways:
- Pressing \a &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;F&gt; key combination starts new
search; the text previously entered by the user in the edit control of
the \b Find toolbox is automatically selected.
- Pressing \a &lt;/&gt; (slash) key starts new search; the text
previously entered by the user is cleared.
- Pressing \a &lt;F3&gt; key repeats previous search in the forward
direction (from top to bottom).
- Pressing \a &lt;Shift&gt;-&lt;F3&gt; key repeats previous search in
the backward direction (from bottom to top).
- Activating \a Find command from the Object Browser context popup
menu starts new search (the same as \a &lt;Ctrl&gt;-&lt;F&gt;).

Pressing \a &lt;Escape&gt; key closes the \b Find toolbox.

The search is always started beginning from the first selected item in
the Object Browser. If there are no selected items, the search is
started from the top of the Object Browser contents. If there is an
item which satisfies the search conditions, it is selected and
Object Browser is expanded to show this item (if it is collapsed).

The \b Find toolbox provides a set of widgets which are used to
perform the search operations or affect on the search conditions:
- \a "Close" button closes the \b Find toolbox.
- Line edit box is used to enter the text to be searched. Note that
search is alwasy done by the object name, i.e. by the data displayed
in the "Name" column of the Object Browser.
- \a "Find first item" button searches the very first item
which satisfies the search condition.
- \a "Find previous item" button searches the previous item
which satisfies the search condition.
- \a "Find next item" button searches the next item
which satisfies the search condition.
- \a "Find last item" button searches the very last item
which satisfies the search condition.
- \a "Case sensitive" check box allows performing case sensitive
search.
- \a "Regular Expression" check box allow performing the search of the
items by the regular expression, for example:
  - <i>Face</i> - matches all faces
  - <i>Face_[\\d]</i> - matches Face_1, Face_2, etc.. (all faces)
  - <i>Face_[\\d]$</i> - matches Face_1, Face_2, but not matches Face_11, Face_12.
  - <i>^Face_[\\d]$</i> - same as above
  - <i>^ Face_[\\d]$</i> - matches nothing

- \a "Wrap search" check box: when it is switched on and search
reaches last item, satisfying the search conditions, pressing \a "Find
Next" button moves the selection to the very first item which matches
search conditions (i.e. cyclic search is performed).

If there are no items in the Object Browser which satisfy the search
conditions, the edit control of the \b Find toolbox becomes
red-colored:

The \b Find toolbox has also auto-hiding feature. This works as
follows:
- If input focus is inside the \b Find toolbox, auto-hiding is
automatically deactivated.
- If input focus moves outside the \b Find toolbox, it hides
automatically in 10 seconds after the last search operation (which can
be done by clicking \a "Find Next", \a "Find Previous" button, or typing
something in the edit field); it means that each new search operation
restarts the auto-hide timer.
