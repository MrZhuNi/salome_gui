This section contains some hints that might be useful when working
with SALOME GUI input widgets.

<h1>Spin boxes</h1>

This type of widgets is used for numeric (integer or floating-point)
data input. Spin boxes are used in standard \b SALOME modules in case
if an input value has clearly defined input range (and precision in
case of floating-point value).

Input precision has specific semantics in \b SALOME floating-point
spin boxes:
- Positive value means that a number in a fixed-point format
(corresponding to "f" format specifier for C printf function) is
expected. Positive precision value is the maximum allowed number of
digits after the decimal separator.
- Negative precision value means that a number either in a fixed-point
or scientific (exponetial) format is expected. This is similar to
behavior of "g" format specifier for C printf function. Absolute
precision value is the maximum allowed number of significant digits in
mantissa (note that one digit is always before the decimal separator).

To make the user aware of an input value constraints applied by some
\b SALOME operation, the following basic capabilties are provided by
spin boxes:
- Text entered manually into a spin box by the user is checked to be a
number of valid type (integer or floating-point).
- The text is converted to a number and checked against the valid
range.
- Additionally, for floating-point data the input text is checked
against the precision rules described above.

In case if the input text in a spin box does not satisfy the
constraints, the user is informed about this by a message shown in a
tooltip near the spin box just as he types in it. The tooltip contains
information about valid data range. For floating-point input, the
tooltip also contains information about expected precision. 

In standard \bSALOME modules precision value can be adjusted through
\ref setting_preferences_page "user preferences" of correspodning  modules, and the tooltip contains a
reference to corresponding parameter in the preferences.

On-line documentation for each standard SALOME module contains the
list of user preferences that can be used for tuning floating-point
precision for different type of input quantities.

<h2>Spin boxes and SALOME Notebook</h2>

Apart from numeric input, spin boxes in some \b SALOME modules accept
names of \b Notebook variables (see \ref using_notebook "Using Notebook" 
page for more details about \b Notebook).

If some spin box accepts variable names, then it is
additionally checked whether the manual input text represents a variable name. Variable
names should satisfy common naming rules for \b Python variables.
In case if the input is neither a valid number nor a variable name,
the tooltip is shown informing the user that variable names are
also acceptable in this spin box.
