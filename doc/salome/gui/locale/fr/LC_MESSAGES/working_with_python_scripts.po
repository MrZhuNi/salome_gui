"**SALOME** Platform can be launched in the batch mode, without Graphical "
"User Interface, and operated with the use of Python scripts, which can "
"fulfill most of the necessary tasks, however, the process of scripting is"
" quite time consuming and rather error-prone."

"This problem has been resolved by the possibility to automatically "
"generate a set of Python scripts from data created with SALOME GUI, which"
" greatly increases the productivity of using SALOME platform in the batch"
" mode. This mechanism can convert a SALOME Study in one or several Python"
" scripts, which can be stored and imported later to re-create the content"
" of the original study. The first script is a SALOME document, which re-"
"creates the SALOME Study, adds the stored Salome components to the SALOME"
" and automatically calls Python scripts of the second type containing "
"component specific Python function calls. This architecture gives great "
"flexibility in manual modification of the generated scripts because you "
"can modify only one of the component specific Python scripts without "
"touching others, thus avoiding expert knowledge of Python API of unused "
"components."
