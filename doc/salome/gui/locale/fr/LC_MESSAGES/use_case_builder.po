"In SALOME, the representation of the data tree in the Object browser for "
"the *full* (CORBA-based) module is done basing on the study contents as "
"it is supplied by SALOME data server (SALOMEDS). In contrast to the "
"*light* module which data tree is completely defined and can be easily "
"attuned by the module specific implementation, *full* module must publish"
" its data in the CORBA study by means of the corresponding API of SALOME "
"data server, namely **SALOMEDS::StudyBuilder**."

"As soon as data entities are published in the study, they are shown in "
"the Object browser, in the same order as they appear in the study tree. "
"Re-arrangement of the data entities with such approach is not a trivial "
"task: for example, when copying/moving any data entity at the new "
"position within the tree, it is necessary to copy all its attributes as "
"well and to clear (in case of move operation) the data entity at the "
"original position. Also, it is not possible to make some data items in "
"the tree \"invisible\" for the user (though it might be useful)."
